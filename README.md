## Overview

This is a sorting algorithm visualization web app using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/). 

The application has been deployed on Heroku.

## To-Dos: 
So far, we've only implemented Bubble Sort and Merge Sort. We'd like to add more sorting algorithms in the furture.
